# Visualizing amounts

I have also added the actual numerical values that each bar represents. Whenever your plot is meant to display only a small number of key values, it makes sense to add the actual numbers to the plot. This substantially increases the amount of information conveyed by your plot without adding much visual noise.

## Don't use a logscale y axis with a bargraph

You can use either a bargraph or a logscale y axis, but not both in combination.
