# Handling overlapping points

Let's revisit this figure from Chapter \@ref(small-axis-labels) and focus on an aspect we ignored there:
<img src="overlapping_points_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
I have labeled this figure "ugly" here because the points overlap and partly obscure each other. A simple way to ameliorate this issue is to use partial transparency:
<img src="overlapping_points_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
