## Proportions

Proportions can be visualized as pie charts, side-by-side bars, or stacked bars, the latter arranged either vertically or horizontally (Chapter \@ref(visualizing-proportions)).

## Individual distributions

Histograms and density plots (Chapter \@ref(histograms-density-plots)) provide the most intuitive visualizations of a distribution, but both require arbitrary parameter choices and can be misleading. Cumulative densities and q-q plots (Chapter \@ref(ecdf-qq)) always represent the data faithfully but can be more difficult to interpret.

## Multiple distributions

Boxplots, violin plots, jittered points, and sina plots are useful when we want to visualize many distributions at once and/or if we are primarily interested in overall shifts among the distributions (Chapter \@ref(boxplots-violins)). Stacked histograms and overlapping densities allow a more in-depth comparison of a smaller number of distributions, though stacked histograms can be difficult to interpret and are best avoided (Chapter \@ref(histograms-density-plots)). Ridgeline plots can be a useful alternative to violin plots and are often useful when visualizing very large numbers of distributions or changes in distributions over time (Chapter \@ref(boxplots-violins)).
