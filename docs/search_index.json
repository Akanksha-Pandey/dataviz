States in the West and South have seen the largest increases, whereas states in the Midwest and Northeast have seen much smaller increases or even, in the case of Michigan, a decrease. Figure 2.3: Example qualitative color scales. The Okabe Ito scale is the default scale used throughout this book. 2.3 Color as a representation of a value Figure 2.4: Example sequential color scales. Figure 2.5: Example diverging color scales. 2.4 Dos and Don’ts of color use Figure 2.6: Population growth from 2000 to 2010 versus population size in 2000, for all 50 US states and the Discrict of Columbia. Every state is marked in a different color, but it is not possible to reliably match the colors in the legend to the dots in the scatter plot. This figure violates two principles: (i) don’t use spurious colors; (ii) don’t use overly saturated colors. Notes: Color as quantification: colored map "]
