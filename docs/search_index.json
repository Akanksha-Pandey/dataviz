From 1961 to 1983, the German parliament (called the Bundestag) was composed of members of three different parties, CDU/CSU, SPD, and FDP. During most of this time, CDU/CSU and SPD had approximately comparable numbers of seats, while the FDP typically held only a small fraction of seats. For example, in the 8th Bundestag, from 1976–1980, the CDU/CSU held 243 seats, SPD 214, and FDP 39, for a total of 496. This type of data, where different parts combine into a total, is most commonly visualized as a pie chart (Figure 10.1). Figure 10.1: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as a pie chart. This visualization shows clearly that the ruling coalition of SPD and FDP had a small majority over the opposition CDU/CSU. A pie chart breaks a circle into slices such that the area of each slice is proportional to the fraction of the total it represents. The same procedure can be performed on a rectangle, and the result is a stacked bar chart (Figure 10.2). Depending on whether we slice the bar vertically or horizontally, we obtain vertically stacked bars (Figure 10.2a) or horizontally stacked bars (Figure 10.2b). Figure 10.2: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as stacked bars. (a) Bars stacked vertically. (b) Bars stacked horizontally. It is not immediately obvious that SPD and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU. We can also take the bars from Figure 10.2a and place them side-by-side rather than stacking them on top of each other. This visualization makes it easier to perform a direct comparison of the three groups, though it obscures other aspects of the data (Figure 10.3). Most importantly, in a side-by-side bar plot the relationship of each bar to the total is not visually obvious. Figure 10.3: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as side-by-side bars. As in Figure 10.2, it is not immediately obvious that SPD and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU. Many authors categorically reject pie charts and argue in favor of side-by-side or stacked bars. Others defend the use of pie charts in some applications. My own opinion is that none of these visualizations is consistently superior over any other. Depending on the features of the dataset and the specific story you want to tell, you may want to favor one or the other approach. In the case of the 8th German Bundestag, I think that a pie chart is the best option. It shows clearly that the ruling coalition of SPD and FDP jointly had a small majority over the CDU/CSU (Figure 10.1). This fact is not visually obvious in any of the other plots (Figures 10.2 and 10.3). (Table 10.1). Table 10.1: Pros and cons of common apporaches to visualizing proportions: pie charts, stacked bars, and side-by-side bars. Pie chart Stacked bars Side-by-side bars Clearly visualizes the data as proportions of a whole ✔ ✔ ✖ Allows easy visual comparison of the relative proportions ✖ ✖ ✔ Visually emphasizes simple fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 ✔ ✖ ✖ Looks visually appealing even for very small datasets ✔ ✖ ✔ Works well when the whole is broken into many pieces ✖ ✖ ✔ Works well for the visualization of many sets of proportions or time series of proportions ✖ ✔ ✖ Figure 10.4: Marketshare of five hypothetical companies for the years 2015–2017, visualized as side-by-side bars.
