Cumulative densities and q-q plots (Chapter 12) always represent the data faithfully but can be more difficult to interpret. 9.3 Multiple distributions Boxplots, violin plots, jittered points, and sina plots are useful when we want to visualize many distributions at once and/or if we are primarily interested in overall shifts among the distributions (Chapter 13). Stacked histograms and overlapping densities allow a more in-depth comparison of a smaller number of distributions, though stacked histograms can be difficult to interpret and are best avoided (Chapter 11). Ridgeline plots can be a useful alternative to violin plots and are often useful when visualizing very large numbers of distributions or changes in distributions over time (Chapter 13). 9.4 Other "]
