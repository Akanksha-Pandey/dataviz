Figure 10.1: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as a pie chart. This visualization shows clearly that the ruling coalition of SPD and FDP had a small majority over the opposition CDU/CSU. Figure 10.2: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as stacked bars. (a) Bars stacked vertically. (b) Bars stacked horizontally. It is not immediately obvious that SPD and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU. Figure 10.3: Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag, 1976–1980, visualized as side-by-side bars. As in Figure 10.2, it is not immediately obvious that SPD and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU. None of these three types of visualizations are consistently superior over any other, however. Depending on the features of the dataset and the specific story you want to tell, you may want to favor one or the other approach. Table 10.1: Pros and cons of common apporaches to visualizing proportions: pie charts, stacked bars, and side-by-side bars. Pie chart Stacked bars Side-by-side bars Clearly visualizes the data as proportions of a whole ✔ ✔ ✖ Allows easy visual comparison of the relative proportions ✖ ✖ ✔ Visually emphasizes simple fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 ✔ ✖ ✖ Looks visually appealing even for very small datasets ✔ ✖ ✔ Works well when the whole is broken into many pieces ✖ ✖ ✔ Works well for the visualization of many sets of proportions or time series of proportions ✖ ✔ ✖ Figure 10.4: Marketshare of five hypothetical companies for the years 2015–2017, visualized as side-by-side bars. Figure 10.5: Marketshare of five hypothetical companies for the years 2015–2017, visualized as stacked bars. Figure 10.6: Marketshare of five hypothetical companies for the years 2015–2017, visualized as pie charts. Additional things this chapter needs: Stacked density distributions (continuous x axis); treemap (maybe move to separate chapter, visualizing nested proportions?). "]
