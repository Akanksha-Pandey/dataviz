# Choosing the right visualization software

Throughout this book, I have purposefully avoided one critical question of data visualization: How do we actually generate our figures? What tools should we use? This question can generate heated discussions, as many people have strong emotional bonds to the specific tools they are familiar with. I have often seen people vigorously defend their own preferred tools instead of investing time to learn a new approach, even if the new approach has objective benefits. And I will say that sticking with the tools you know is not entirely unreasonable. Learning any new tool will require time and effort, and you will have to go through a painful transition period where getting things done with the new tool is much more difficult than it was with the old tool. Whether going through this period is worth the effort can usually only be evaluated in retrospect, after one has fully made the transition. Therefore, regardless of the pros and cons of different tools and approaches, the overriding principle is that you need to pick one that works for you. If you can make the figures you want to make, without excessive effort, then that's all that matters. 

```{block type='rmdtip', echo=TRUE}
The best visualization software is the one that allows you to make the figures you need.
```

Having said this, I do think there are general principles we can use to assess the relative merits of different approaches to producing visualizations. These principles roughly break down by how easy it is to rapidly explore the data, how reproducible the resulting visualizations are, and to what extent the visual appearance of the output can be tweaked.


## Data exploration versus publication-ready figures


Throughout much of the 20th century, data visualizations were drawn by hand, mostly by technical illustrators who did so for a living. 

One notable example is Randall Munroe, creator of the web comic XKCD, 

(ref:sequencing-cost) After the introduction of next-gen sequencing methods, the sequencing cost per genome has declined much more rapidly than predicted by Moore's law. Data source: National Human Genome Research Institute

```{r sequencing-cost, out.width = "70%", fig.cap='(ref:sequencing-cost)'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/sequencing_costs.png", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```



## Reproducibility and repeatability

In the context of scientific experiments, we refer to work as reproducible if the overarching scientific finding of the work will remain unchanged if a different research group performs the same type of study. For example, if one research group finds that a new pain medication reduces perceived headache pain significantly without causing noticeable side effects and a different group subsequently studies the same medication on a different patient group and has the same findings, then the work is reproducible. By contrast, work is repeatable if very similar or identical measurements can be obtained by the same person repeating the exact same measurement procedure on the same equipment. For example, if I weigh my dog and find she weighs 41 lbs and then I weigh her again on the same scales and find again that she weighs 41 lbs, then this measurement is repeatable.


We can apply these concepts to data visualizations with minor modifications. A visualization is reproducible if the plotted data are available and any data transformations that may have been applied are exactly specified. For example, if you make a figure and then send me the exact data that you plotted, then I can prepare a figure that looks substantially similar. We may be using slightly different fonts or colors or point sizes to display the same data, so the two figures may not be exactly identical, but your figure and mine convey the same message and therefore are reproductions of each other. A visualization is repeatable, on the other hand, if it is possible to recreate the exact same visual appearance, down to the last pixel, from the raw data. Strictly speaking, repeatability requires that even if there are random elements in the figure, such as jitter (Chapter \@ref(overlapping-points)), those elements were specified in a repeatable way and can be regenerated at a future date. For random data, repeatability generally requires that we set and record a seed for the random number generator.

**Make an example of a figure that reproduces but doesn't repeat another figure. Use a different theme, colors, point sizes, etc. Maybe also use altered jitter. And also refer to Chapter \@ref(avoid-line-drawings) which has several more such examples.**

(ref:lincoln-lincoln-repro) Repeat and reproduction of a figure. Part (a) is a near-complete repeat of Figure \@ref(fig:lincoln-temp-jittered). With exception of the exact sizes of the text elements and points, which were adjusted so the figure remains legible at the reduced size, the two figures are identical down to the random jitter that was applied to each point. By contrast, part (b) is a reproduction but not a repeat. In particular, the jitter in part (b) differs from the jitter in part (a) or Figure \@ref(fig:lincoln-temp-jittered).

```{r lincoln-repro, fig.width = 8.5, fig.asp = .32, fig.cap = '(ref:lincoln-lincoln-repro)'}

## Separation of content and design

A good plotting software allows you to think separately about content and design. 

**Refer back to the figure from the previous subsection which shows the same content using different designs.**

(ref:unemploy-themes) Number of unemployed persons in the U.S. from 1970 to 2015. The same figure is displayed using four different designs: (a) the default design for this book; (b) the default design of ggplot2, the plotting software I have used to make all figures in this book; (c) a design similar to visualizations shown in the Econommist; (d) a design similar to visualizations shown by FiveThiryEight. FiveThirtyEight often foregos axis labels in favor of plot titles and subtitles. Data source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

```{r unemploy-themes, fig.width = 8.5, fig.asp = 0.75, fig.cap = '(ref:unemploy-themes)'}
unemploy_base <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "unemployed (x1000)",
                     limits = c(0, 17000),
                     breaks = c(0, 5000, 10000, 15000),
                     labels = c("0", "5000", "10,000", "15,000"),
                     expand = c(0.04, 0)) +
  scale_x_date(name = "year",
               expand = c(0.01, 0))

unemploy_p1 <- unemploy_base + theme_minimal_grid(12) +
  geom_line(color = "#0072B2") +
  theme(axis.ticks.length = grid::unit(0, "pt"),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
unemploy_p2 <- unemploy_base + geom_line() + theme_gray()
unemploy_p3 <- unemploy_base + geom_line(aes(color = "unemploy"), show.legend = FALSE, size = .75) +
  theme_economist() + scale_color_economist() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .75))
unemploy_p4 <- unemploy_base + geom_line(aes(color = "unemploy"), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "United States unemployment",
       subtitle = "Unemployed persons (in thousands) from 1967\nto 2015") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))

plot_grid(unemploy_p1, NULL, unemploy_p2, 
          NULL, NULL, NULL,
          unemploy_p3, NULL, unemploy_p4,
          labels = c("a", "", "b", "", "", "", "c", "", "d"), label_fontface = "plain",
          rel_widths = c(1, .02, 1),
          rel_heights = c(1, .02, 1))
```
