# Introduction

*Write about visualizations vs. figures. This book is specifically about static visualizations presented in print, online, or in presentations. The book does not cover interactive visuals or movies. For this reason, we will use the words "visualization" and "figure" somewhat interchangeably.*


Data visualization is part art and part science. The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong and vice versa. A data visualization first and foremost has to be correct, which means it must not mislead about or distort the data. If one number is twice as large as another, but in the data visualization they look to be about the same, then the visualization is incorect. At the same time, a data visualization should be aesthetically pleasing. Good visual presentations tend to enhance the message of the visualization. If a figure contains jarring colors, imbalanced visual elements, or other features that distract, then the viewer will find it harder to inspect the figure and interpret it correctly.

Scientists typically know how to visualize data without being grossly misleading, but they may not have a well developed sense of visual aesthetics and they may inadvertantly make visual choices that detract from their desired message. Designers, on the other hand, may prepare visualizations that look beautiful but play fast and lose with the data.
