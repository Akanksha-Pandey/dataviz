# Introduction {-}

If you are a scientist, an analyst, a consultant, or anybody else who has to prepare technical documents or reports, one of the most important skills you need to have is the ability to make compelling figures. Figures will typically carry the weight of your arguments. They need to be clear, attractive, and compelling. The difference between good and bad figures can be the difference between a highly influential or a obscure paper, a grant or contract won or lost, a job interview gone well or poorly. And yet, there are surprisingly few resources to teach you how to make compelling figures. There are no college courses on figure making, and no extensive collection of books you can read.^[One notable exception is the works of Edward Tufte. His books and seminars are excellent, and much of what I do and say has been inspired by him.] Tutorials for plotting sofware typically focus on how to achieve specific visual effects rather than explaining why certain choices are preferred and others not. In your day-to-day work, you are simply expected to know how to make good figures, and if you're lucky you have a patient adviser who teaches you a few tricks as you're writing your first scientific papers.

In the context of writing, experienced editors talk about "ear", the ability to hear (internally, as you read a piece of prose) whether the writing is any good. I think that when it comes to figures and other visualizations, we similarly need "eye", the ability to look at a figure and see whether it is balanced, clear, and compelling. And just as is the case with writing, the ability to see whether a figure works or not can be learned. Having eye means primarily that you are aware of a larger collection of simple rules and principles of good visualization, and that you pay attention to little details that other people might not.

In my experience, again just as in writing, you don't develop eye by reading a book over the weekend. It is a lifelong process, and concepts that are too complex or too subtle for you today may make much more sense five years from now. I can say for myself that I continue to evolve in my understanding of figure preparation. I routinely try to expose myself to new approaches, and I pay attention to the visual and design choices others make in their figures. I'm also open to change my mind. I might today consider a given figure great, but next month I might find a reason to criticize it. So with this in mind, please don't take anything I say as gospel. Think critically about my reasoning for certain choices and decide whether you want to adopt them or not.

This book is written as a series of independent blog posts, and there is no need to read it cover to cover. Feel free to skip around, to pick out a specific section that you're interested in at the moment, or one that covers a specific design choice you're pondering. In fact, I think you will get the most out of this book if you don't read it all at once, but rather read it piecemeal over longer stretches of time, try to apply just a few concepts from the book in your figuremaking, and come back to read about other concepts or re-read concepts you learned about a while back. You may find that the same chapter tells you different things if you re-read it after a few months of time have passed.

Even though all the figures in this book were made with R and ggplot2, I do not see this as an R book. I am talking about general principles of figure preparation. The software used to make the figures is incidental. You can use any plotting software you want to generate the kinds of figures I'm showing here, even if ggplot2 and similar packages make many of the techniques I'm using much simpler than other plotting libraries. Importantly, because this is not an R book, I do not discuss code or programming techniques anywhere in this book. I want you to focus on the concepts and the figures, not on the code. If you are curious how any of the figures were made, you can check out the book's source code at its GitHub repository, https://github.com/clauswilke/professional_figures.


## Acknowledgments {-}

This project would not have been possible without the fantastic work the RStudio team has put into turning the R universe into a first-rate publishing platform. In particular, I have to thank Hadley Wickham for creating ggplot2, the plotting software that was used to make all the figures throughout this book. I would also like to thank Yihui Xie for creating the knitr package, R Markdown, and bookdown. I don't think I would have started this project without these tools ready to go. Even though I have over 20 years of experience authoring documents in LaTeX, and I have written and continue to write almost all my scientific papers using that platform, the idea of writing a LaTeX document that contains hundreds of figures, having to maintain the R code for all these figures separately, and having to manually organize storage and naming of all the figure files makes me cringe. By contrast, writing self-contained R Markdown files is fun, and it's easy to collect material and gain momentum.
