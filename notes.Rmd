# Notes

A few easy chapters to write soon:

- visualizing paired data (use protein correlation data from Echave et al?)
- solid colors vs. outlines

Topics to cover eventually:

- pie charts
- multi-part plots
- scatter plots of dense point clouds, chapter is partially started
- visualizing distributions 1: histograms and density plots
- visualizing distributions 2: boxplots, violins, and more
- choice of plot libraries
- avoid boxes and frames around parts of the plot
- don't go 3d

Other notes and comments:

- need a clear system of stamping figures while keeping some spacing. current system is ad-hoc and inconsistent. This touches all chapters already written.
- aspect ratio chapter needs to be completed
- in the colorblind package, add color simulations using the dichromat R package?
- this looks like a useful resource: [dataviz catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/about.html)
- the [viridis package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=viridis) has several great color scales
