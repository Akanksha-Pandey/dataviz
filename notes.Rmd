# Notes

A few easy chapters to write soon:
- visualizing paired data (use protein correlation data from Echave et al?)
- visualizing distribution (use iris?)

Topics to cover eventually:

- bitmaps vs vector graphics
- pie charts
- multi-part plots
- scatter plots of dense point clouds, chapter is partially started
- histograms and density plots
- solid colors vs. outlines
- choice of plot libraries
- avoid boxes and frames around parts of the plot
- redundant coding (to help color-blind people, and generally), labeling vs legends
- don't go 3d

Other notes and comments:

- aspect ratio chapter needs to be completed
- this looks like a useful resource: [dataviz catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/about.html)
