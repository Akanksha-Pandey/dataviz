# Notes

Topics to cover eventually:

- bitmaps vs vector graphics
- pie charts
- background grids: add diagonal lines
- labeling vs legends
- multi-part plots
- scatter plots of dense point clouds, chapter is partially started
- histograms and density plots
- solid colors vs. outlines
- choice of plot libraries
- avoid boxes and frames around parts of the plot
- redundant coding (to help color-blind people, and generally)
