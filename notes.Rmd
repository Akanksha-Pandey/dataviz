# Notes

A few easy chapters to write soon:

- visualizing paired data (use protein correlation data from Echave et al?)
- visualizing distribution (use iris?)

Topics to cover eventually:

- pie charts
- multi-part plots
- scatter plots of dense point clouds, chapter is partially started
- histograms and density plots
- solid colors vs. outlines
- choice of plot libraries
- avoid boxes and frames around parts of the plot
- redundant coding (to help color-blind people, and generally), labeling vs legends
- don't go 3d

Other notes and comments:

- aspect ratio chapter needs to be completed
- in the colorblind package, add color simulations using the dichromat R package
- this looks like a useful resource: [dataviz catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/about.html)
- the [viridis package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=viridis) has several great color scales
