```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# run setup script
source("_common.R")
```

# Telling a story with data {#telling-a-story}

## Make a figure for the generals


```{block type='rmdtip', echo=TRUE}
When you're trying to show too much data at once you may end up not showing anything.
```


## Build up towards complexity


## Don't be repetitive

*If you're showing the same type of figure over and over you will bore your readers.*

## Use a consistent visual language
