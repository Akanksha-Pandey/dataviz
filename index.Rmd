# Preface {-}

This book is meant as a guide for making figures that look professional and are publication-ready. It has grown out of my experience of having to repeatedly give my trainees the same kinds of advice---use larger fonts, pay attention to the aspect ratio of your figure, use solid colors rather than outlines, and so on. Now, I can just aks them to read the appropriate chapters in this book.

The entire book was written in R Markdown, using RStudio as my text editor and the **bookdown** package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole. The book's source code is hosted on GitHub, at https://github.com/clauswilke/professional_figures. If you would like to fix typos or other issues, feel free to send me pull requests through GitHub. In your commit message, please add the sentence "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Claus O. Wilke," so that I can maintain the option of publishing this book in other forms. For comments, questions, or requests for additional chapters, please open an issue on GitHub.
