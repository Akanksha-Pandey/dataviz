This repository holds the R Markdown source for the book "Fundamentals of Data Visualization" to be published with Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc. A rendered version of the completed book chapters is [available here.](http://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) The book requires a supporting R package [available here.](https://github.com/clauswilke/dviz.supp)

The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book.
